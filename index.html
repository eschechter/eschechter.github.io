			Is there any difference between a person's having an experience and their believing they are having one? Because the experience is subjective, it by definition is only real to its observer: its existence cannot be verified by a physical experiment. Following one line of logic, this implies that the experience is real only in the sense that the observer behaves as if they are having it. Thus, an explanation for why humans believe they have subjective experiences fully puts to rest all questions about consciousness.

			Another line of reasoning finds this argument completely unsatisfactory. We don't just <i> believe </i> we're conscious; we see, feel, and experience. Consciousness is not a belief, it is the "what it's like" of our existence. When I see the color red, I am aware of seeing the color, but red also looks like <i> something</i>. A satisfactory explanation of consciousness would have to explain what that something is.
